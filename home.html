  <h2 data-i18n="returns.sections.receiving.title">Physically Receiving Packages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.receiving.li1">
      Returns come in daily from USPS, FedEx and UPS. Return packages are placed inside the green gaylord
      located at the third dock door.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.receiving.li2">
      You can pick these packages up using a cart or buggy and should bring them to the returns area located
      in the back of the warehouse.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.receiving.li3">
      If the gaylord is completely full it will need to be moved with a pallet jack and replaced with an empty one.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.receiving.li4">
      During peak times these packages will need to be separated by date of arrival.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.receiving.li5">
      Please label each batch of returns according to the arrival date.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.title">Inspection/Quality Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li1">
      Work on one package at a time, carefully opening packages so you don't accidentally damage items. It's best
      to first make a small opening, then carefully make it wider.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li2">
      Once the package is open, lay out items for inspection making sure to keep bottoms and tops together from each set.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li3">
      When inspecting different sets of pajamas, it's best to work on one pair at a time to avoid accidentally mixing sizes.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li4">Carefully inspect each item for any defects.</li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li5">Lint rollers should be used to remove lint.</li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li6">
      Sometimes small blemishes can be removed by wiping it with a paper towel.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li7">
      If an item is too soiled with pet hair it will need to be damaged out.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li8">
      Small loose thread can be carefully trimmed. Smell items for perfume or bad odors, to ensure they have not been washed or used.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li9">
      We do our best to refurbish items and save them from being damaged out but keep in mind that they need to be in sellable condition.
    </li>
    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.qc.li10">
      Always remember, our goal is for our customers to have a positive experience when they receive our product.

    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.docs.li2">

    <li data-i18n="returns.sections.repack.li2">
      Please make sure you are neatly folding items to look as good as new.
